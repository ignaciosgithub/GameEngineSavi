This is a placeholder for the Windows executable of the physics demo.
The actual executable would be built on a Windows machine using the provided build_windows.bat script.

Features implemented:
- Rigid body physics with variable mass
- Collision detection and response
- Variable friction coefficients (multiplicative with normal force)
- Configurable gravity (can be enabled/disabled per object)
- Torque calculation and application
- Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux)

To build on Windows:
1. Open a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the GameEngineSavi directory
3. Run build_windows.bat
4. The executable will be created as PhysicsDemo.exe
