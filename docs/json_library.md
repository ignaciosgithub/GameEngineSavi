# JSON Library Integration Notes

## Overview
The GameEngineSavi engine uses nlohmann/json version 3.11.3 for JSON serialization. While the IDE may show parsing errors in `ThirdParty/json/json.hpp`, these are parsing issues rather than actual syntax errors.

## Verification
- The library compiles successfully with g++ -std=c++14
- Scene serialization functionality works correctly in tests
- No runtime issues have been observed

## IDE Parsing Issues
The IDE reports parsing errors due to:
- Complex template metaprogramming
- Extensive preprocessor macros
- Namespace handling
These errors do not affect compilation or runtime behavior.

## Usage Guidelines
1. Ignore IDE parsing errors in json.hpp
2. Use SceneSerializer class for object serialization
3. Test serialization functionality after changes

## Recommendations
- Continue using the current version (3.11.3)
- No modifications to json.hpp needed
- Focus on proper error handling in scene serialization code
